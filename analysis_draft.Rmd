### Tentative Project Title
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Data Analysis across Countries

### Motivation
The primary goal is to analyze information on HIV prevalence, incidence rates, and AIDS mortality from available studies, identifying the most vulnerable gender, sub-population, and geographic region.

### Intended Final Products
Multiple dashboards/web pages reflecting the prevalence and incidence rates of HIV across countries and subgroups.

### Anticipated Data Sources
United States Censusâ€™s HIV/AIDS Surveillance Data Base

## Exploratory Analysis
```{r EDA}
# Histogram for HIV incidences

incidence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = inc_rate)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black")

# add a small constant 0.01 to each value and conduct log transformation

log_inc = log(pull(incidence,inc_rate)+0.01)

incidence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = log_inc)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black")

# Histogram for HIV prevalences

POR = log(pull(prevalence,prev_rate)/(1-pull(prevalence,prev_rate)))
prevalence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = prev_rate)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black")

# add a small constant 0.01 to each value and conduct log transformation

log_prev = log(pull(prevalence,prev_rate)+0.01)

prevalence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = log_prev)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black")


tri = (pull(prevalence,prev_rate))^(1/2)





prevalence |>
  ggplot(aes(x = tri)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black")


```

## Statistical Testing
```{r Stat Tests}
# Load necessary libraries
library(broom)  # For tidy statistical summaries

# ANOVA for numeric variables (e.g., age)
aov_prev = aov(prev_rate ~ sex, data = prevalence) |> broom::tidy()
aov_inc = aov(inc_rate ~ sex, data = incidence) |> broom::tidy()
print(glue::glue("\nANOVA for HIV Prevalence Rate by Age:\n"))
print(aov_prev)
print(glue::glue("\nANOVA for HIV Incidence Rate by Age:\n"))
print(aov_inc)


# t test: Difference in HIV incidence rate between the circumcised and uncircumcised 

circumcise = 
  incidence |>
  mutate(
    subpop = recode(subpop,
                                 'Adults - circumcised' = 'circumcised',
                                 'Adults - uncircumcised' = 'uncircumcised')) |>
  filter(subpop %in% c('circumcised','uncircumcised'))

ttest_result = t.test(inc_rate ~ subpop, data = circumcise) |> broom::tidy()
print(glue::glue("\nT-Test for HIV incidence by circumcision status among adults:\n"))
print(ttest_result)

```
According to the results of ttest, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that there's difference in incidence rate between the circumcised and uncircumcised adults. the uncircumcised adults are more likely to get HIV compared with the circumcised adults.





- Chi-Square Test: Used for testing relationships between categorical variables.
- ANOVA: Analyzes differences between group means and their associated procedures.
- T-Test: Compares the means of two groups.
- Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Validation of Data:

- Ensure hiv_df_filtered contains the necessary columns (gender, new_hiv_incidences, aids_mortality, age, age_group, geographic_region).
- Validate the assumptions for each statistical test (e.g., normality for t-test and ANOVA, independence for Chi-square).
